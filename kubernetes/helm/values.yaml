# The HH cluster has 8 workers. Each k8s worker comes with 8 cores and 32GB of RAM.
# The resources of this cluster will be divided as follows:
# - Public website (3 workers - using 88 of 96GB)
# - Test website (1 worker - using 22 of 32GB)
# - Export app (1 worker - using 30 of 32GB)
# - Rfam batch search (1 worker - using 20 of 32GB)
#
# Note: hh-rke-wp-webadmin-12-worker-4 was disabled because for some reason
# the RNAcentral app does not work on this worker.
