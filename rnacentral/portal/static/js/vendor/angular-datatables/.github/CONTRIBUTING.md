# Got a Question or Problem?

You can ask questions by posting an issue. There is no problem, I'll just add the label `question`.

However, please follow those simple guidelines before posting:

1. Describe your issue in an understandable english (english is not my native language, but I still try to write something decent, and so should you).
2. Please be polite (and occasionally avoid being a beggar... :unamused:).
3. Provide a code to illustrate your issue. A [plnkr](http://plnkr.co/) or something alike is better.
4. Github provides us a wonderful [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) (text-to-HTML), so use it without restraint, especially when putting your code.
5. Some really good advices on how to ask question:
  * on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)
  * on [DataTables](https://datatables.net/manual/tech-notes/10)

Well, that's just some common sense, so it should not be so hard to follow them.

Thank you.
