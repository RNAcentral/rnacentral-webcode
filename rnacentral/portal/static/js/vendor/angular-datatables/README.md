# FAQ
## Why version 2.X? Where is version 1.X?

Since AngularJS has released a version 2 that is breaking everything, I made a version 2 for simplicity purpose, to indicate the major version of this library is using the version 2 of AngularJS. 

## Why is there less functionnalities?

Because, I'm still working on it... But, if you want to contribute, feel free to make a pull request!

## Will you still work on version 0.X.Y?

Only on bugs, and only if I have the time (which I don't really have much nowadays...)

## Why no BowerJS? GruntJS?

Let's not multiply the tools and do all in NPM! 

## Where is the Angular renderer? What about the Promise renderer?

Not developed yet!

## Where are the DTOptionsBuilder, DTColumnBuilder and DTColumnDefBuilder?

In the first versions of angular-datatables, there were some builder to help using the directive.
However, they seem to have brought more confusion instead. So, starting from version 2, you will need to provide the options directly, like in the DataTable's documentation.
