### miRNAs targeting mRNAs

miRNAs regulate protein gene expression by [interacting with target mRNAs](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.03.006).

RNAcentral now imports protein target interactions from [TarBase](/expert-database/tarbase).

The data can be searched:

- Browse [human miRNAs with known protein targets](/search)
- Browse [mouse miRNAs with known protein targets](/search)
- Search for [protein targets identified using HITS-CLIP](/search)

The protein targets are not searchable by default to avoid spurious matches
but can be searched using the special syntax:

- [target:"ENSG"](/search)
- [experimental_method:"hits-clip"](/search)

### miRNAs targeting long non-coding RNAs

RNAcentral will import data from [LncBase](http://carolina.imis.athena-innovation.gr/diana_tools/web/index.php?r=lncbasev2%2Findex)
in one of the next releases.
