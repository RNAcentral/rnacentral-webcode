## Overview

RNAcentral LitSumm is designed to produce automated summaries for a large number of ncRNA genes using advanced
[natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) techniques, specifically built
upon the [GPT-3.5 model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models). These summaries are generated by selecting relevant
sentences extracted from scientific literature, enabling researchers to quickly grasp the key information about these genes.

For example, [Homo sapiens (human) microRNA hsa-mir-944 precursor](/rna/URS0000663F9C/9606?tab=pub) lists over 200
articles about **MIR944**. Using sentences from that list of articles, LitSumm was able to create the following
summary:

<a href="/rna/URS0000663F9C/9606">
    <img class="thumbnail" src="/static/img/litsumm-example.png">
</a>

**It is important to note that this summary is automatically generated using artificial intelligence and therefore may
not be completely accurate or comprehensive.**

LitSumm is under active development and more summaries will be available in the future.

## How LitSumm works

### LitScan Pipeline

The foundation of the LitSumm is the [LitScan](/help/litscan) pipeline. This text mining pipeline establishes
connections between RNA sequences and the latest open access scientific literature. It accomplishes this by utilizing a
collection of identifiers (Ids), gene names, and synonyms provided to RNAcentral by Expert Databases. LitScan scans
papers available in [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/), ensuring that the publications linked to RNAcentral entries
remain up-to-date.

### Named Entity Recognition (NER) Extension

The LitSumm tool enhances the capabilities of the LitScan pipeline by incorporating extensions to the named entity
recognition (NER) process. These extensions enable the extraction of passages that are directly relevant to ncRNA genes.
By identifying key entities within the literature, such as gene names and synonyms, LitSumm ensures the extraction of
passages that are most informative for summarization.

### LitSumm Summarization Process

The summarization process of the LitSumm tool involves a sequence of steps to produce high-quality summaries for ncRNA
genes. The process can be summarized as follows:

1. **Selection**: Relevant snippets are selected from the literature using the enhanced LitScan pipeline.
2. **LLM Driven Summarization**: The selected snippets are fed into the GPT 3.5 language model, which generates coherent and concise summaries.
3. **Automated Checking**: The generated summaries undergo an automated checking process to ensure accuracy and coherence.
4. **Automated Refinement**: When necessary, summaries are refined automatically to improve their quality and accuracy.

### Automated Checking and Refinement

LitSumm incorporates an automated checking mechanism to validate the generated summaries. This ensures that the
summaries accurately reflect the content of the selected literature passages. Additionally, automated refinement
processes are applied as needed to enhance the clarity and coherence of the summaries.
