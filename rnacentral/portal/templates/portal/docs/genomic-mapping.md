Viewing ncRNA sequences in their genomic context can often provide valuable information.
For example, snoRNAs that are transcribed within the introns of protein coding genes
become readily apparent when viewed in a genome browser
(e.g. [human SNORD91B RNA](/rna/URS0000269B1D/9606)).

RNAcentral imports genome locations from [Ensembl](https://ensembl.org) and other Expert Databases.
In addition, sequences are mapped to the reference genomes using **blat**.

RNAcentral sequences can be viewed
in their genomic context using a light-weight **genome browser** powered by [Genoverse](http://genoverse.org).
**External links** are provided to the fully-featured genome browsers such as [Ensembl](http://ensembl.org),
[Ensembl Genomes](http://ensemblgenomes.org), and [UCSC genome browser](http://genome.ucsc.edu/).

The genomic coordinates of the RNAcentral entries can be **downloaded** in a variety of formats
from the [FTP site](/downloads) or through the [REST API](http://rnacentral.org/api).
