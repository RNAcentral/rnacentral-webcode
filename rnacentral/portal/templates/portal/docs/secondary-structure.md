# Secondary structure

RNAcentral displays secondary structure using
the [auto-traveler](https://github.com/RNAcentral/auto-traveler) software that
automatically generates the diagrams in standard layouts (*manuscript in preparation*).
The templates enable comparison between structures and show the differences
relative to the template.

For example, the following *Thermus thermophilus*
[small ribosomal subunit structure](/rna/URS000080E226/274)
where nucleotides in black are unchanged compared to
the [CRW](http://www.rna.ccbb.utexas.edu) template
and the differences are shown in different colours:

</a>

Some secondary structures are provided by Expert Databases,
such as [GtRNAdb](/expert-database/gtrnadb).
