## What are Conserved Motifs?

Conserved RNA motifs or conserved RNA structures (CRS) are structured elements
of RNA molecules that are conserved across species.
They have been computationally identified in multi-species vertebrate alignments
from **structure-based**, rather than sequence-based, alignments in the following study:

> The identification and functional annotation of RNA structures conserved in vertebrates.

RNAcentral collected non-overlapping CRS motifs that were additionally filtered for Rfam overlap.
RNAcentral displays them as features in the **feature viewer** on sequence report pages
and provides links to the [RTH Database](https://rth.dk/resources/rnannotator/crs/vert/)
where additional information can be found, including multiple sequence alignments,
secondary structure, and tissue expression.
