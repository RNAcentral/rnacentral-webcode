## What are Conserved Motifs?

Conserved RNA motifs or conserved RNA structures (CRS) have been identified based on multi-species vertebrate alignments in the following study:

> The identification and functional annotation of RNA structures conserved in vertebrates.

> *- Seeman et al., Genome Research 2017.*

RNAcentral displays CRS motifs as features in the sequence features viewer
and provides links to the [RTH Database](https://rth.dk/resources/rnannotator/crs/vert/)
where additional information can be found, including multiple sequence alignments,
secondary structure, and tissue expression.

- [Mouse eosinophil granule ontogeny transcript (Egot, Gm27813)](/rna/URS0000A7D0F3/10090)
