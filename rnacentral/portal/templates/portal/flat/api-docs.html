## RNAcentral API Documentation

Most data in RNAcentral can be accessed programmatically using RESTful API
allowing for integration with other websites

## Browsable API

The data is hyperlinked so that one can navigate the API without leaving the browser.
This brings the API very close to being self-documented.
Depending on whether the URL is viewed in the browser or is retrieved by a command line client,
the response is either rendered as HTML or Json.
RNAcentral provides versioned API browsable.

## Versioning

To ensure that changes in the RNAcentral APIs don't break the third-party applications
relying on it, the API is versioned, and the version is included in the API URL.
For example, the current version is Version 1 and is available at <a href="/api/v1">/api/v1</a>.

No backward incompatible changes are made to each version after it's been made public.

* deleting fields
* changing urls

An advance notice will be given before obsoleting an API version.

The current API can also be accessed at <a href="/api/current">/api/current</a>,
but it's not recommended to use this endpoint for long-term
development as the underlying data model may change.

## Pagination options

The response is paginated to prevent accidental downloads of large amounts of data and to speed up the API.
The default pagination size is <strong>10</strong> entries, but it can be adjusted by specifying the <code>page_size</code> parameter.
The maximum value of <code>page_size</code> is <strong>100</strong>.

## Example

* <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/rna/?page_size=5">http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/rna/?page_size=5</a>
* <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/rna/?page=2&page_size=5">http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/rna/?page=2&page_size=5</a></p>

## Throttling

To ensure that the resource is highly available and used 10 per second

It is based on the Django Rest Framework
