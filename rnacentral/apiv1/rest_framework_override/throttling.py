The throttling classes are overriden after a problem with the Ensembl Das system.

The issue was caused by bad Memcached keys
set by the throttling layer of the RNAcentral API.
The remote address header and the X_FORWARDED_FOR headers
were concatenated with a whitespace character, which is not allowed in Memcached keys.
